Postdoctoral Associate, University of Wisconsin Milwaukee

I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, working with Prof. Jolien Creighton and Prof. Patrick Brady. My research in Gravitational Wave Astrophysics focuses on the detection and interpretation of gravitational wave events, with a particular emphasis on machine learning-enhanced search algorithms for gravitational wave observatories. I completed my PhD at IIT Bombay under Prof. Archana Pai and previously held a postdoctoral position at the University of Florida, collaborating with Prof. Imre Bartos.

My recent work investigates binary black hole mergers in active galactic nuclei and the GW190521 event, contributing to a deeper understanding of binary formation and eccentric features in gravitational wave events. As part of the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, I lead searches for intermediate-mass black hole binaries and eccentric binary mergers using the coherent WaveBurst algorithm.



**Broad interests:**  Gravitational wave astronomy.

**Specific Interests:**

• Detection algorithms of gravitational wave transients with interferometric detectors.
• Search for intermediate-mass black hole binaries and eccentric binary black hole mergers from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observation data.
• Enhancing gravitational waves science with machine learning.
• Noise Veto Techniques
