My research explores the intricate role of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the formation and evolution of binary black hole systems, focusing on how AGN accretion discs serve as a dynamic environment for the creation of binary black hole mergers. In particular, I have investigated how the dense gas within AGN discs can catalyze black hole mergers, contributing significantly to the gravitational wave signals detected by observatories like LIGO and Virgo. My work spans a series of studies that delve into different aspects of this phenomenon, including the dynamics of binary formation and the gravitational wave event rate.

In this [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04187), we examine the rates of black hole mergers within AGN discs, providing a deeper understanding of gravitational wave signals originating from such environments. In a complementary study, [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09097), I explored the role of AGN-assisted mergers in generating high-eccentricity black hole binaries, shedding light on unique gravitational wave signatures. Additionally, [this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10350) focuses on the formation channels of binary black holes within AGN, offering detailed models of how gravitational waves from AGN environments differ from those in isolated binaries.

My earlier work includes [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00605) on the accretion dynamics of massive black holes within AGN discs, providing a theoretical framework for how these environments shape black hole mergers. In [another study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04781), I analyzed the interaction between AGN discs and stellar-mass black holes, demonstrating how AGN can serve as a catalyst for increasing the merger rate of black hole binaries.

Further contributions include investigating the possibility of detecting AGN-driven mergers in dense environments, such as in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11142), and modeling their contribution to the gravitational wave background, as outlined [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09281).
